                When you fill in the enquiry form on this site or get in touch by
                phone or email, we collect only what you give us — typically your
                name, your email address, your postcode, and a short description
                of your garden.
              </p>

            <Section title="Why we collect it">
              <p>
                We use your details to reply to your enquiry, arrange a visit,
                and provide a quote. If you go ahead with us, we keep the
                details on file so we can run the work and send invoices.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title="Who we share it with">
              <p>
                We do not share your details with third parties for marketing.
                We may use email or messaging providers to deliver our reply
                (such as a standard email service); those providers process
                your message only to deliver it.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title="How long we keep it">
              <p>
                Enquiries we do not act on are deleted within twelve months.
                Customer details are kept for the duration of the work and for
                a reasonable period afterwards for accounting purposes.
              </p>

            <Section title="Your rights">
              <p>
                You can ask us at any time what information we hold about you,
                ask for it to be corrected, or ask us to delete it. The easiest
                way is to email us using the contact details below.
